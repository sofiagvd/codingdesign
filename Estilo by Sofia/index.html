            <p>A new meta-analysis examines 40 years' worth of research in an attempt to find out the ideal amount of fiber that we should consume to prevent chronic disease and premature mortality. Researchers and public health organizations have long hailed the benefits of eating fiber, but how much fiber should we consume, exactly?
            This question has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to commission a new study. The results appear in the journal The Lancet. The new research aimed to help develop new guidelines for dietary fiber consumption, as well as reveal which carbs protect the most against noncommunicable diseases and can stave off weight gain.

           Watermelon ( Citrullus Lanatus) is related to squash, cucumbers, cantaloupe and pumpkins, which all grow on sprawling vines on the ground. A native to Africa, this melon was a refreshing treat for the Egyptians 5,000 years ago! The fruit eventually made its way around the world; early explorers actually used them as canteens. More than 96 countries around the world produce more than 1,200 varieties of watermelons. The U.S. and Mexico alone grow 200 to 300 varieties, including 50 of the most popular. The 5 most popular are seeded, seedless, mini, yellow and orange flesh. Watermelon season runs throughout the summer -- from May to September -- but the exact range depends on where you live, Keep an eye out at your local farmers market. You can't miss these big guys, and there will be plenty at peak season.
